# Website Locker Extension
Lock away time-wasting websites by default and unlock them for a period of time by press the unlock button. Click on the extension icon to get a dropdown of the settings and lock/unlock buttons. You have the option to whitelist or blacklist websites on the list. A blacklist locks the websites on the list and a whitelist locks every website except the ones on the list.
